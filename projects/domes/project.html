	<h1 class="pop">From Herndon Homes<br>to Two Georgia Domes</h1>
	<p class="pop">From Herdon Homes to Two Georgia Domes is the name of my Master’s Thesis Project. In 1988, a group of Booker T. Washington high school students interviewed 13 Vine City residents about the 1992 Georgia Dome. In 2015, the Historic Westside Cultural Arts Council and the Participtory Publics Lab at Georgia Tech interviewed 10 Westside residents about the 2017 Georgia Dome. This exhibit contextualizes these interviews with historical analysis and archival material by historian Todd Michney.

	<h3 class="pop">The Design:</h3>
	<p class="pop">The primary goal of the exhibit is to allow users to interact with the content that has been gathered during the duration of this project. The content includes historical photography, historical news media, oral history videos, and oral history audio.</p>
	<p class="pop">In designing the exhibit, I want to give the user’s a close up view of the content, as well as a zoomed out view, to show the content in a greater context. To do this, I have broken down the content into multiple small screens with the data itself, as well as an aggregate large screen to contextualize the content.</p>
	<p class="pop">In the design of the interaction, I am trying to leverage exploration and a linear storytelling. The final artifact will have a series of themes and filters from which the user can follow a path, but also jump between themes and explore the content in a non-sequentially. The small screens will be what the user has control over, the large screen will show the themes and paths they can explore.</p>
